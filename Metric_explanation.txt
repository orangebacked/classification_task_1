The metric chosen was the f1 score for two main reasons: first, the dataset is balanced; I needed clear guidance about what I had to optimize, recall or accuracy. Both could be important, so I decided to optimize the f1, which was the harmonic mean between these two metrics. The results of this metric were used in a holdout set, and it is available in the Jupiter notebook. Using cross-validation of the holdout set, the model achieved an 80% f1 mean score between 10 folds. There is no decision function in the Random forest classifier; therefore, creating a roc curve is impossible.
